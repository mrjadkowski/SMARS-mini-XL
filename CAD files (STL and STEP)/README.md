## Printing notes for printing these parts successfully
### Materials and print settings.
I printed in a mix of ASA (yellow) and PETG (black), but only so I could have different colors. I don't think the materials choice really matters as long as your printer settings are good. There are a lot of small round towers involved so layer adhesion is important. I printed everything with a .2mm layer height and 10% infil. 
### Notes for individual parts
#### Rubber Band Drive Wheel
You need four of these. The .STL file includes supports already. Print them flat face down. Once the part has totally cooled you can remove the center support by using a thumb tack or other small metal tool to lever the cylinder to the side. It should snap away cleanly from the inside of the wheel hub. Remove each half of the groove support by sliding the same thumb tack in between the two halves and then under one. Lever it up, and then you should be able to grab it with your fingers and pull it away. Repeat for the other side.

Depending on the mix of materials you use, and how much they contract when cooling, you may have to adjust the scale of these by 1-2% either way for the right fit. These fit perfectly at 100% scale for me using ASA. When they snap on to the wheel hubs on the chassis, they will initially be a snug fit, but they break in to spin freely and have very little play.
#### APDS-9960 Face
Print this right-side-up (same orientation as when it is installed on the robot). It will require some supports under the overhangs on the rear that attach it to the chassis.
#### Chassis
Print this right-side-up (same orientation as when it is installed on the robot). It will require supports under the overhanging wheel hubs for the non-driven wheels.
#### GY-530 Rear Carrier
Print this face-down (tabs up). It doesn't require supports.
#### Feather Support
Print this right-side up (posts up). It doesn't require supports.
#### Top Cover
Print this upside-down (flat-surface down). It doesn't require supports.
