These wiring diagrams mostly reflect the actual wiring, with a few exceptions:
 - This design does not actually use the Adafruit DRV8833 motor controller breakout board. It is just the only Fritzing DRV8833 motor controller breakout board I could find. The BOM has a link to the actual board that is used. Becase of this, the actual wiring connections on the actual motor controller board are slightly different than the design. On the board, they are labeled IN1 - IN4. The motor outputs are labeled OUT1 - OUT 4. AIN1 = IN1, AIN2 = IN2, BIN1 = IN3, BIN2 = IN4. AOUT1 = OUT1, AOUT2 = OUT2, BOUT1 = OUT3, BOUT2 = OUT4.
 - THe APDS-9960 connects using the Stemma QT connector, but the Fritzing object doesn't include that connector so it shows the hardwired connections. Use a pre-made Stemma QT cable from Adafruit to connect from the Stemma QT connector on the APDS-9960 (or any other Stemnma QT sensor board) to the Stemma QT connector on the RP2040.
